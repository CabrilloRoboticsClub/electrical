# MATE ROV Electrical Stack for 2024 ROV Seahawk II

## Overview
This year, we decided to develop a stack of custom boards for the first time. We made this decision to reduce the size and weight of the Seahawk II while also improving overall durability, reliability, and power consumption. In the past, wiring harnesses were a significant point of failure, so we aimed to reduce their use.

The Seahawk II electrical stack focuses on high integration. We reduced the number of boards to three, which all connect seamlessly. This minimized space requirements. While the R&D expenses for developing these boards were high, the completed stack is incredibly reliable and significantly reduces costs compared to off-the-shelf options.
