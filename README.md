# MATE ROV Electrical Stack for 2024 ROV Seahawk II

## Overview

This year, we decided to develop a stack of custom boards for the first time. We made this decision to reduce the size and weight of the Seahawk II, while also improving overall durability, reliability and power consumption. In the past, wiring harnesses were a significant point of failure, so we aimed to reduce their use.

The Seahawk II electrical stack focus on making everything highly integrated. We were able to reduce the count of boards down to three boards that all plug into eachoter. By doing this we were able to minmise space. While the R&D expences for the development of theses boards was costly the now that this stack is devolped it is incredibly reliable and greatly reduces cousts compared to off the shelf opptions on the market.
