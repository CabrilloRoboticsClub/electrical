# MATE ROV Electrical Stack for 2024 ROV Seahawk II

## Overview

This year, we decided to develop a stack of custom boards for the first time. We made this decision to reduce the size and weight of the Seahawk II, while also improving overall durability, reliability and power consumption. In the past, wiring harnesses were a significant point of failure, so we aimed to reduce their use. Additionally, they are time-consuming to manufacture.
